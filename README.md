This program uses the Rapportive API to find someone's email address based on information that you supply.

It's purpose is for networking and personal outreach, it is NOT for spamming or selling to influencers. Please use it responsibly or it will be removed.

It seems to have the most problems with non-gmail addresses... still trying to figure out why. Let me know if you have any ideas

##Dependencies:

Before you can run this program you'll need the Rapportive Python plugin from here:https://github.com/jordan-wright/rapportive

(Credit to Jordan Wright for creating such a simple and intuitive python rapportive API)

Just download his repo and install it before running this one.

##Installation:

There's no installation. Just go to your command line and run "python main.py" within the proper directory

##Usage:

Using the program is very simple. You'll be prompted to enter a number of user details (first name, last name, nickname, middle initial, and work email)
You'll also be asked if you want to check Gmail, since most people these days have a Gmail address.

At this time, I have not added functionality to figure out their work email address from a name of a company, so you'll need to find that yourself. I intend to add it in the future.

Please be professional and courteous, don't spam people just because you can find their email address now.

##Updates:

If you think of any ways to improve the email possibilities function, or any other part of it really, please just submit a push request and I'll likely accept it.
